# â˜• Java Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of Java projects! This repository showcases various applications and simulations developed to deepen my understanding of Java programming and object-oriented design. The projects range from GUI-based applications to simulations demonstrating concurrency and design patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

### ðŸš— Car Project
A simulation application that models car behavior, demonstrating multi-threading and synchronization in Java.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-threading: Simulates concurrent processes such as engine operation and speed control.
- Synchronization: Ensures thread-safe operations between different components.
- Observer Pattern: Implements the observer design pattern to update the UI based on state changes.

### ðŸ“š Library Management System
A console-based application that manages a collection of books, showcasing object-oriented design and data handling.

**Key Features:**
- Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes classes and objects to represent books and library operations.
- Collections & Streams: Employs Java collections framework and stream API for efficient data processing.
- Serialization: Saves and loads library data using Javaâ€™s serialization mechanism.
- Exception Handling: Implements robust error handling for user inputs and file operations.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- JavaFX SDK (for Car Project GUI)
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (recommended for running and editing projects)
- No external libraries required â€” all projects use standard Java libraries
